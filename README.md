## Me in this project

## Introduction
> Nothing is more unpredictable than the financial market.

Bankruptcy is a leagal process overseen by federal bankruptcy courts to allow individuals or businesses freedom from their debts, while simultaneously providing creditors an opportunity for repayment.

The concept of time series is applied into the project. A time series a sequence of observations of variables taken at a regular time intervals and it can be decomposed into a trend, a seasonal (or a cyclical), and an irregular component. The trend component is the long-term behavior of the series; the cyclical component is the regularly periodic movements, and the irregular component is stochastic. The goal is to estimate and forecast the untypical elements. 

In this project, I would like to control the irregularity, narrow biases, and get the result as accurate as possible. After these steps, I then could conclude the trend for the bankruptcy rate in the upcoming two years.

## Data & Variables
From 1980 to 2017, monthly country-level data including the unemployment rate, the bankrtupcy rate, and the house price index is used in the project. [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start) and [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) are the main database.
